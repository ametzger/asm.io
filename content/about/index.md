Howdy! I'm Alex. I'm a software developer from Boston, Massachusetts.

I currently work at [Jellyfish](https://jellyfish.co/), a startup
providing software engineering analytics tools. If you're interested
in working with me, [check out our open
positions](https://jobs.lever.co/jellyfish)

Previously, I worked at [Litmus](https://litmus.com), [NGP
VAN](https://ngpvan.com), and [C Space](https://cspace.com). I did a
co-op at [MIT](https://mit.edu) while I was a student at [Northeastern
University](https://ccs.neu.edu).

Outside of work I enjoy cycling, snowboarding, and photography.

If you'd like to get in touch, you can find me on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/metzger) and
[GitHub](https://github.com/ametzger). You may also reach me via
[email](mailto:asm@asm.io). If you'd like to contact me security, my

Thanks for stopping by!
