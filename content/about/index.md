Howdy! I'm Alex. I'm a software developer and cloud enthusiast from
Boston, Massachusetts.

I currently work at [Jellyfish](https://jellyfish.co/), a startup
providing software engineering analytics tooling. If you're interested
in working with me, don't hesitate to [reach out]({{< ref "/contact/"
>}}).

Previously, I worked at [Litmus](https://litmus.com), [NGP
VAN](https://ngpvan.com), and [C Space](https://cspace.com). I did a
co-op at [MIT](https://mit.edu) while I was a student at [Northeastern
University](https://ccs.neu.edu).

My background is software development with a focus on ops and
cloudiness. I am somewhat experienced with computer security, just
enough to know how little I truly understand.

Outside of work I enjoy cycling, snowboarding, and photography.
