- idea: add timer, see how long user can keep a majority of emoji as the same one

- move to scheme where emojis pause once clicked
  - clicking an emoji still changes all of them to the same emoji
  - clicking an emoji keeps that emoji as the same one always, and resumes swapping it if it is
    clicked again
- move to separate script file?
  - need to update content-security-policy
